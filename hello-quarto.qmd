## Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## YAML Header

-   state: "Virginia" = key value pair. Can use in-line or in code chunks

I used to live in `r params$state`.

```{r}
toupper(params$state)
```

## In-line code to refer to a result

```{r}

model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)

```

Coefficient of lm model is equal to `r coef(model)[["speed"]]`.

## Here

library(here) can be used to organize sub-directories.

## Math Mode

In-line:

...binomally distributed random variable, $X \sim binom(n, p)$.

Chunk:

$$
P(X = x) = {n \choose x} p ^ x (1-p) ^ {n-x}
$$ {#eq-binomial}

Chunk will center equation and automatically add equation numbers.

Can use for Greek alphabet:

Change is often symbolized as $\Delta$.

You can create page breaks as follows, but only works in PDF:

Equation for RMSE:

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (y- \hat{y})^2}
$$ {#eq-rmse}

## Cross-references {#sec-crossref}
